Fix process spawn output method

Having stderr pipe to htmlStream would prevent the program from
handling messages sent to stderr.

Changes:
- Removed listener for ‘close’
- Remove putInputBox from ‘exit’ listener
- Added ‘data’ variable to stdout and stderr listeners
- Remove stderr pipe to htmlStream
- Stderr listener now pushes the message itself
